50 lines of Javascript code to help you sort tables (requires Prototype library)

Example table:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th class="sortable"></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Entry ABC</td>
    <td>3 comments</td>
  </tr>
  ...
</table>

The first click will sort ascending.
The second click will sort descending.
The third click will return to the initial order on page load.

For Rails apps:
- Copy sortable_table.js into public/javascripts and include it
- Copy sortable_table.css into public/stylesheets and include it
- Copy arrow_down.gif and arrow_up.gif into public/images
